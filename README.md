This script was made to facilitate the configuration of my WSL development environment. It is adapted to my needs,
so it may not fully satisfy you. Fell free to aplly the necessary changes to your environment.

## 📋 Features

In short, `install.sh`, install and configure:

- zsh with Oh-My-Zsh, Zinit and Spaceship theme
- NVM with latest node lts and yarn

## 🚀 Install

### Automatic

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniodecanini/my-env-configs/master/install.sh)"
```
